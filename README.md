## 0. Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## 1. Install developer tools

You can install the developer tools natively or use Dev Containers.

### Option 1: Natively install developer tools

#### 1.1 Starkup

Tool for installing all the Starknet essentials for development. [Starkup](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) will install the latest stable versions of:

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) - Cairo package manager and build toolchain
- [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html) - Development toolchain for testing on Starknet
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) - Version manager to easily switch between tool versions
- [Cairo 1.0 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1) for VSCode - Syntax highlighting and language support

>Currently, [starknet-devnet](https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-devnet/) is not supported by `starkup` and needs to be installed separately (see instructions below).

To install `starkup`, run the following command:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
```

#### 1.2 Create your project

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-stark@latest
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

Now you have a new project with the basic structure.

#### 1.3 Install Starknet Devnet using ASDF Fast Install

- Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) in case you don't have it installed yet. It allows you to manage the other dependencies with ease.

We are almost done, now we need to install `Starknet Devnet`. First let's register the Starknet Devnet plugin on `asdf`.

```bash
asdf plugin add starknet-devnet
```

Now open your new created project. Since we have the required dependencies listed on a `.tool-versions` file, simply running the below command on the root folder will install `starknet-devnet`(and other dependencies such as `scarb` and `starknet-foundry`) with the version SPECIFIED on the `.tool-versions` file (not necessarily the latest):

```bash
asdf install
```

Now you are ready!!!. You can jump to [Quickstart 1](#quickstart-1-deploying-a-smart-contract-to-starknet-devnet) to start developing your dapp.

#### 1.4 Troubleshooting

- If you run into version errors after using `starkup` or `asdf`, you can try to install the dependencies manually. Check the details below.

<details>

#### Scarb version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your `Scarb` version must be `2.11.4`. To accomplish this, first check Scarb version:

```sh
scarb --version
```

If your `Scarb` version is not `2.11.4`, you need to install it. If you already have installed `Scarb` via `starkup`, you can setup this specific version with the following command:

```sh
asdf install scarb 2.11.4 && asdf set scarb 2.11.4
```

Otherwise, you can install Scarb `2.11.4` following the [instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf).

#### Starknet Foundry version

To ensure the proper functioning of the tests on scaffold-stark, your `Starknet Foundry` version must be `0.44.0`. To accomplish this, first check your `Starknet Foundry` version:

```sh
snforge --version
```

If your `Starknet Foundry` version is not `0.44.0`, you need to install it. If you already have installed `Starknet Foundry` via `starkup`, you can setup this specific version with the following command:

```sh
asdf install starknet-foundry 0.44.0 && asdf set starknet-foundry 0.44.0
```

Otherwise, you can install Starknet Foundry `0.44.0` following the [instructions](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html#installation-via-asdf).

#### Starknet-devnet version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your `starknet-devnet` version must be `0.4.1`. To accomplish this, first check your `starknet-devnet` version:

```sh
starknet-devnet --version
```

If your `starknet-devnet` version is not `0.4.1`, you need to install it.

- Install starknet-devnet `0.4.1` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://github.com/gianalarcon/asdf-starknet-devnet/blob/main/README.md)).

</details>

### Option 2. Dev Containers

#### 2.1 Install Docker Desktop

As an alternative to installing the tools locally (Scarb, Starknet Foundry, Starknet Devnet), you can use Docker, this is the recommended option for `Windows` users. Here's what you need to do:

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2. Install [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Create a new project folder.

- `npx create-stark@latest`
- `cd my-dapp-example`

4. Check your project folder contains a `devcontainer.json` file. This file is used to set up the environment:

- The configuration uses the `starknetfoundation/starknet-dev:2.11.4` image.
- This includes all required tools pre-installed, such as Scarb, Starknet Foundry, Starknet Devnet and other dependencies.

#### 2.2 Getting Started with Docker Setup

To start using the Docker-based setup:

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Select **"Reopen in Container"**.
3. If you need to rebuild the container, open the Command Palette (**View -> Command Palette**) and choose:
   - **Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**

> Once inside the container, you can start working with all the tools and dependencies pre-configured.

Now you are ready!!!

## Compatible versions

- Starknet-devnet - v0.4.1
- Scarb - v2.11.4
- Snforge - v0.44.0
- Cairo - v2.11.4
- Rpc - v0.8.0

## Quickstart 1: Running Friends Locally

To get started with Friends, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd friends
yarn install
```

2. Run a local Starknet network in the first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the Pooler contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This deploys the Pooler smart contract that manages group savings pools. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/Pooler.cairo`.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can now:
- Create new savings goals
- Invite friends to contribute
- Track progress in real-time
- Test the full savings flow

5. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `packages/nextjs` and `packages/snfoundry`
   - The `yarn postinstall` script will handle this automatically
   - Configure your RPC endpoints and other settings as needed

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Never commit private keys or sensitive environment variables to version control.

## Quickstart 2: Deploying to Sepolia Testnet

<details>

1. Prepare your environment variables:
   - In `packages/snfoundry/.env`: Add your wallet's account contract address and private key
   - In `packages/nextjs/.env`: Configure your Sepolia testnet RPC URL

2. Update your network configuration:
   - Find `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`
   - Set `targetNetworks` to `[chains.sepolia]`

3. Get test tokens:
   - You'll need STRK tokens on Sepolia to create and contribute to pools
   - Get tokens from:
     - [Starknet Faucet](https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/)
     - [Blastapi Starknet Sepolia STRK](https://blastapi.io/faucets/starknet-sepolia-strk)

4. Deploy the Pooler contract:

```bash
yarn deploy --network sepolia
```

5. Start the frontend:

```bash
yarn start
```

Your dapp will now be connected to Sepolia testnet, ready for testing with real network conditions.

</details>

## Setup RPC specific version

<details>

To ensure the proper functioning of the scaffold-stark with Testnet or Mainnet, your RPC version must be `0.8.0`. This repository contains `.env.example` files, where we provided the default RPC URL for the Starknet Testnet: `RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8`. Let's verify this RPC version is `0.8.x` by calling a `POST` request in an API platform like `Postman` or `Insommia` . Your API endpoint should be `https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8` and the body should be:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "starknet_specVersion",
  "id": 1
}
```

You have to paste the endpoint and body in the API platform and click on the `Send` button. If the response is `0.8.x`, then you are good to go. Otherwise, you have to get the correct RPC URL endpoint.

</details>

## Network Configuration Centralization

<details>

By default, Network settings are centralized in `scaffold.config.ts` with all RPC URLs defined in the `rpcProviderUrl` object. We strongly recommend to use environment variables to configure the networks, otherwise the framework will choose a random provider for you.

**How to Change Networks:**

- Update the `targetNetworks` array in `scaffold.config.ts` (first network is the primary target)
- Ensure each network has a corresponding RPC URL in the `rpcProviderUrl` object

### Required Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVNET_PROVIDER_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_PROVIDER_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_PROVIDER_URL`

Configuration uses these variables with fallbacks:

```typescript
"devnet": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVNET_PROVIDER_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL || "",
"sepolia": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_PROVIDER_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL || "",
"mainnet": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_PROVIDER_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL || ""
```

## CLI Usage

<details>
Depending on your package manager, substitute the word `COMMAND` with the appropiate one from the list.
